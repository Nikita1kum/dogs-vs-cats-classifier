# dogs-vs-cats-classifier
This repository contains code for an image classification model built using data science techniques in Python. The model distinguishes between images of cats and dogs, and it is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook hosted on Google Colab.

##Overview
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, and this project focuses on distinguishing between two popular categories: cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of both cats and dogs, and it utilizes deep learning techniques to learn patterns and features from the images.

##Technologies Used:
Python

TensorFlow

Keras

Google Colab


##How to Use
To use this image classifier:

1.Open the Notebook: Open the Cat_vs_Dog_Image_Classifier.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.

2.Set Up Environment: Make sure to set up the Colab environment with necessary libraries and dependencies.

3.Data Preparation: Upload your dataset or use the provided dataset containing images of cats and dogs.

4.Training: Execute the cells in the notebook to train the model on your dataset.

5.Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

6.Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new images of cats and dogs.

7.Dataset
